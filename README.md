jquery.graph
============

MS Chart with MVC3 is rendered through jquery plugin

The jQuery plugin created for rendering chart on web pages. This works along with a MVC3 controller at server side. So, number of charts are available without paying anything to 3rd Party control. 

The MVC3 at server takes the 'Chart' control provided by Microsoft for ASP.NET in the form of 'System.Web.UI.DataVisualization.Charting' namespaces.

Example & Code:
===============
   + The html example is available on ..\ob.graph\Views\Chart\Index.chtml page. 
   + The C# controller code is on ..\ob.graph\Controller\ChartController.cs
   + The jQuery Plugin, is as ..\ob.graph\Scripts\jquery.graph.js



Limitation:
==============================================
   + This is basic version and only renders a Pie chart.
